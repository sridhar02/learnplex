## Work on Issues
1. Find an issue that needs assistance by searching for the [open issues](https://github.com/coderplex/learnplex/issues).
1. If you are new, you can start with [these issues](https://github.com/coderplex/learnplex/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
1. If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. 
   If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people 
   don’t accidentally duplicate your effort.
1. If somebody claims an issue but doesn’t follow up for more than a weeks, it’s fine to take over it but you should
   still leave a comment.

## Proposing a change
1. Open a new issue if you would like report a bug or suggest improvements.
1. Please wait for core team members to comment on the thread. This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before
   you put significant effort into it.

1. Push the code to your fork.
1. Raise the pull request from your created branch to `master` branch of learnplex.
